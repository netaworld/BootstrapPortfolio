              <p>
                  Hello!
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  My name is Cindy. I was born in country Latvia. You can find this country in Europe.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Now I live in NC Charlotte. Love this country and this state.
                  According to my teacher we need to have two paragraphs for this project. That is why I will
                  use jokes to fill out the space. Thank you for understanding and sorry for inconvenience, and I hope
                  you
                  will like jokes.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  First joke:Judge: “Why did you steal the car?”
                  Man: “I had to get to work.”
                  Judge: “Why didn’t you take the bus?”
                  Man: I don’t have a driver’s license for the bus.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  The second joke:The police stop an old guy in questionable condition at 1 am.
                  “What are you doing out so late, sir?” asks the police officer.
                  “I’m going to a seminar on ‘The harmful effects of alcohol’,” replies the man.
                  “Are you pulling my leg or something?!“ says the police officer, „who would hold a seminar like that
                  at this
                  hour?!”
                  The man sighs,
                  “my wife.”
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Third joke:I have a very good feeling about my job interview today. The manager said they were
                  looking for
                  somebody responsible.
                  “You’ve found your man,” I responded, “whenever there was a problem in my last job, they always said
                  that I
                  was responsible!”
                  One more joke for fun:When I drink coffee I can’t sleep.
                  Really? I have the exact opposite.
                  Wow, seriously?
                  Yes, when I sleep I can’t drink coffee.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Couple more jokes for fun.
                  The guy who invented Systane had his funeral today.
                  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  I got fired from my job as a taxi driver.
                  It turns out my customers didn't like it when I tried to go the extra mile.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  My Dad said to me, "Son, I wanted you to know you were adopted."
                  I shouted, "You're kidding! Really?"
                  He said, "Yes. Get your things together, they're coming to pick you up in an hour."
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Thank you for having me!
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  With respect Cindy
              </p>
